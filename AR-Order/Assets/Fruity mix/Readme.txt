To see the features of the package, open the Demo scene in the Scenes folder.

Pak is a mix of 10 fruits:
• apple
• lemon
• mango
• orange
• papaya
• pear
• persimmon
• plum
• pomelo
• strawberry

Each fruit is divided into two halves. When cutting, there are splashes - particles in the form of spheres.

In the demo scene there is a blade, a trailing Trail, running in 3D mode.

Textures are made in PNG format 1024 x 1024.

The number of verts and tris for each fruit does not exceed 132 verts, 224 tris, which is very good for mobile games or for creating a huge amount of fruit without sacrificing perfomance.
